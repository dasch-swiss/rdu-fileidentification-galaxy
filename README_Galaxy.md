# Galaxy Integration


## Develop the Tool Wrapper XML using Planemo

The following commands assume that Planemo is installed.
Either set up the virtual environment using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), or install planemo in another way.
uv installation instructions:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Spin up Galaxy, to run the tool [in the browser](http://127.0.0.1:9090/):

```bash
planemo serve --biocontainers
```

Run the tests (will only succeed on Linux):

```bash
planemo test --biocontainers fileidentification-galaxy.xml
```

Keep in mind:

- Before running the tests, make sure that Docker Desktop for Mac allows bind mounting of `/private/var/folders`.
- If there is more than 1 line inside the CDATA of the `<command>` block,
  the lines must end with `&&` (but NOT with `\`),
  and new lines must NOT be indented.
- Inside the Docker container, the app is installed in `/app`, which is read-only in Galaxy.
- The commands inside the `<command>` block of the XML file are executed in a dedicated user directory defined by Galaxy - 
  not in the `WORKDIR` specified in the Dockerfile.
- Only the user directory is writable, all other dirs are read-only: the input dir, `/app`, ...
- The Terminal output of the tool slightly differs across operating systems, e.g. regarding the order of files.
  The e2e test will fail on MacOS, because the expected output doesn't exactly match the actual output.
  You can run the e2e test on MacOS anyways, to get a rough idea about what's going on.


### Rebuilding the Docker Image (just for local testing)

If you modify the Python code or the Dockerfile, and open a PR, the automated tests will rebuild the Docker image.
But if you want your local planemo to be aware of your changes, make sure to rebuild the image first:

```bash
TOOL_VERSION=xyz    # copy from macros.xml
docker build -t daschswiss/fileidentification-galaxy:${TOOL_VERSION} .
```


## Tool Shed

Publishing to Galaxy's app store <https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/> is automatically done by tools-iuc,
and configured by `.shed.yml`.
Steps to test if `.shed.yml` is correct:

- Create an account on <https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/>
- Run `planemo config_init`
- In `~/.planemo.yml` > sheds > testtoolshed, fill in your credentials for <https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/>
- Fill in your test account name in `.shed.yml` > owner
- Check the `.shed.yml` with `planemo shed_lint --tools`.
- Create the remote repository with `planemo shed_create --shed_target testtoolshed`.
- DaSCH has an account on the prod toolshed <https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/>,
  which is not used, because of `owner: iuc`.


## How to update the Galaxy Tool

Follow these steps to bring the latest changes from <https://github.com/dasch-swiss/fileidentification>
into Galaxy's tool shed (app store) <https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/>.

Make sure the upstream is set correctly:

```bash
% git remote -v
origin	  git@github.com:dasch-swiss/fileidentification-galaxy (fetch)
origin	  git@github.com:dasch-swiss/fileidentification-galaxy (push)
upstream	git@github.com:dasch-swiss/fileidentification.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:dasch-swiss/fileidentification.git (push)
```

Pull in the changes from upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b sync-upstream
git merge upstream/main -m "Pull in changes from upstream"
```

If anything has changed on <https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/main/tools/fileidentification>,
copy over the changed files into this repo.

Update the versions in `macros.xml`:

- If only the Galaxy wrapper stuff has changed: bump `@VERSION_SUFFIX@`
- If the Python code, Python dependencies, or Dockerfile have changed:
  bump `@TOOL_VERSION@`, according to the version from `pyproject.toml`.
  This is enforced by a GitHub actions check,
  because the images on Docker Hub are versioned according to `@TOOL_VERSION@`.
  Galaxy will only be able to pull a new image from Docker Hub if a new image has been pushed,
  which only happens if `@TOOL_VERSION@` is bumped.

Then, commit your changes and push them:

```bash
git add macros.xml
git commit -m "update versions in macros.xml"
git push -u origin sync-upstream
gh pr create --title "Synchronize fork with upstream changes"
```

Once the automated tests succeed, merge your PR.
If the Python code, Python dependencies, or Dockerfile have changed,
this will automatically publish the newest Docker image to
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/daschswiss/fileidentification-galaxy).

Then, open a PR which updates <https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/main/tools/fileidentification>.
In the simplest case, you can just copy over the `macros.xml`,
but if you modified anything else, then update the other files, too.
Once the PR in tools-iuc is merged, the Galaxy tool will be updated in Galaxy's tool shed.
